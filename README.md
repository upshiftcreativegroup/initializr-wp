<h1>WordPress theme boilerplate</h1>

<p>Hi, you can use this as a starting point for your WordPress theme. FontAwesome version is <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/" target="_blank">4.7.0</a>.</p>

<h2>Included JS plugins</h2>
<p><i>Most</i> of these have jQuery as a dependency. All are located in /js/plugins.js. Associated stylesheets are in /css/ or /scss/.</p>

<h3>Probably will need jQuery</h3>
<ul>
	<li>fancyBox</li>
	<li>ScrollToFixed</li>
	<li>Sidr</li>
	<li>Slick Carousel</li>
</ul>
<h3>No dependencies</h3>
<ul>
	<li>flatpickr</li>
	<li>Parsley</li>
	<li>WP-Embed (de-registered from functions.php to call here instead)</li>
</ul>

<h2>functions.php</h2>
<p>There are some handy things in here. Will find time to list.</p>
